# System-Analysis-Design
This contains articles from the projects I did in this class

These projects were given to the class inorder to expose the students to both the buissness and technical aspects of a software design project. This project had specific requirments within both of these sides of the project. Technical requirements such as a web based application and buissness requirements in the form of only admins being able to perform audits. 
I would revise the diagrams contained within the system design documentation as new demands or improvements propigate in relation to the progression of the project. The most important part of designing this system was meeting the client's needs without compromising the security and stability of the system. I like the UML and the activity diagrams, I can see myself using them for future projects.
